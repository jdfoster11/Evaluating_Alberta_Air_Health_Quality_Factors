Using R, SQL, Pandas & Numpy to perform a comprehensive analysis evaluating the factors impacting alberta air health quality and the average life expectancy.
While this project demonstrates various skills learned through the MDSA program, the final project did not find statistical significance between most factors. The primary reasoning for this is the data quality/quantity available to service this analysis.
